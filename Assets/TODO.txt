  - Figure out how to transfer a particle effect from one object to another

  MECHANICS
  - Remove Double Jump (make it unlockable)
  - Hold-Down to free the orb
  - 
 
  - Experiment with zero-friction hanging mode (make it a sliding mode?)
  - Slide/Stick (which should be default? Toggle or hold?)
  - Auto-Pull/Trail (Auto-Pull is the default. Toggle or hold?)
  - Should stick be tied to auto-pull mode or should it be a separate button toggle?
  - Keyboard accessibility should be kept in mind
 
  - Design Combat/Enemies

  - Ideally Suitable for Local VS Mode (up to 4 players)

  - Design Game Type/Objective (Spelunky? Dust Force? Ori/Metroid?)
