TIPS AND TRICKS
#################################
 - Push orb DOWN against the ground to jump
 - Push orb UP to reach through platforms and pull yourself up
 - Use High-Friction Orb Mode to climb walls, it's a bit tricky though, start by moving the player towards the wall with the orb held diagonally upwards (also towards the wall)
 - Drop through a platform while dragging the orb to hang from the platform
 - Fast-falling with the orb held downwards will give you a slightly higher orb jump
 - The orb will exert a force on the player as long as the orb is in contact with a wall/platform
